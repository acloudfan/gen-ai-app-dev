    "This notebook demonstrates the use of Tree of thought as a 4 step process for a creative writing task.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create *K* plans to approach the task\n",
    "2. Vote the best 1 out of the *K* plans\n",
    "3. Create *N* passages with the best plan\n",
    "4. Vote the best 1 out of the *N* passages\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demonstration, we will use LLM to create a product marketing slogan. The marketing lead has some thoughts in mind that she would like the LLM to follow. Refer to the standard prompt that describes the marketing lead's preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note:\n",
    "1. Since we are using commerical API, it will cost you $ to run the code\n",
    "2. The code can be adjusted for similar tasks by tweaking the prompts, rest of the code stays the same\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Langchain\n",
    "Use of Langchain will simplify the code below. Langchain has **NOT** been used deliberately to show you the concept of LLM chains :) in the next iteration you will use Langchain to rewrite this code. If you already know Langchain, then feel free to use it instead of the solution proposed in this notebook."
