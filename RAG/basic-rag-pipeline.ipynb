Chain-of-thought prompting improves reasoning ability by inducing the model to generate an image as a series of steps that mimic a train of thought. It allows large language models to overcome difficulties with some image generation tasks that require logical thinking and multiple steps to solve, such as generating images based on complex descriptions or conditions.\n",
